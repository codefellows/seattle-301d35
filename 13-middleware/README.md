=======
## Overview

*The focus of this class will be the underlying concepts of client-side middleware and how to manage application state through the use of a routing framework (PageJS).*

## Daily Plan

**Let's talk a little bit about the transition into project week that is coming soon!**

Samples of prior 301 projects:

- [Pump Finder](https://pumpfinder.herokuapp.com/)
- [Run Walk Crawl](http://runwalkcrawl.site/)
- [Plenty of Dogs](http://plenty-of-dogs.site/)
- [Travel Wild](https://team-wildlife.github.io/wildlife-client/)
- [KnoWeathr](https://knoweathr.github.io/knoweathr-client/)

**Code Review: Let's fix some broken code!**

`BREAK (10 minutes)`

**Slides: Middleware**

- What is it?
- Why are we using PageJS?
- The context object `ctx`, `next()`, and working with multiple callbacks in PageJS
- Working with URL params

**What other middleware have seen?**

**Application architecture (The Revenge of Kilovolt: Kilovolt Strikes Back)**

- The final Kilovolt skeleton
- The final Kilovolt middleware

**Code demo (button builder)**

`BREAK (10 minutes)`

**Code demo (to-do app)**

**Discuss the next lab**

## Learning Objectives

* Middleware in PageJS router
* Query params in Context

## Readings

* [Page.js selections](https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js#context) *(Especially the "Context" and “Routing” sections)*
