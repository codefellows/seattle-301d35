=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*The focus of this class is on basic functional programming concepts through the use of the following array methods: `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()`.*

## Daily Plan

- **Code Review**

`10 minute break`

*"Sometimes, the elegant implementation is just a function.  Not a method.  Not a class.  Not a framework.  Just a function."* - [John Carmack](https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/53512300451201024)

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Understand advantages of functional programming and reasons for its recent rise in popularity
* Correctly use **.forEach(), .map(), .filter(), .reduce()** array methods to explore a data set
* Construct modularity with IIFE patterns
