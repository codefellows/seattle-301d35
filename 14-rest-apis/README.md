=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*The focus of this day is on solidifying the underlying concepts of the REST architectural style and how to interact with application resources through the use of the HTTP verbs, jQuery AJAX methods, and keys or tokens as needed, to make GET requests to external public APIs.*

## Daily Plan

*Reminder: the entrance exam for the 401 courses (which doubles as the final exam for this course, and is part of the grade for this course, so you should take it even if not immediately going into a 401) will be published on Friday afternoon and be available until 11:59pm Sunday.*

**How NOT To Build An App**

**Code Review (fix broken code?)**

**Discuss Project Ideas**

`BREAK (10 minutes)`

[REminder about Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) is nice tool for inspecting API responses, such as from `http://swapi.co/api/people/4`. Try entering that into a browser, and then selecting the JSON option from the dropdown at the right. Is it hard to read? Then add JSONView to Chrome!

**Demo with the GitHub API**

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Understand the history of HTTP, and the central role that REST plays.
* Use RESTful routes for a web service, to retrieve their own GitHub repos using an authentication token
