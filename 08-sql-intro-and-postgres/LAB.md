## User Stories and Feature Tasks

*As a user, I want to store my articles in a database so that my articles are available for users from an external source.*

- Install and require the NPM PostgreSQL package `pg` in your server.js file.
- Make sure to complete the connection string.
  - Windows and Linux users: You should have retained the user/password from the pre-work for this course. Your OS may require that your connection string is composed of additional information including user and password. For example: `const conString = 'postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DBNAME'`;
  - Mac users: `const conString = 'postgres://localhost:5432'`;
- Pass the appropriate argument when instantiating a new Client.
- The articleView.js methods are different now that we are not accessing the JSON file directly, and instead retrieving the articles from a database. Therefore, we no longer need to export the JSON, so remove all code that was involved in performing this action.

*As a developer, I want to write proper SQL queries so that I can interact with the blog articles in my database.*

- Write a SQL query to retrieve all of the articles from your database.
- Follow the instructions in the adjacent [08-CRUD-testing.md](08-CRUD-testing.md) doc to verify that everything works.
- Write a SQL query to update a single article in your database. Make sure to provide the appropriate data for the article.
- Follow the instructions in the adjacent [08-CRUD-testing.md](08-CRUD-testing.md) doc to verify that everything works.
- Write a SQL query to remove all articles from your database.
- Follow the instructions in the adjacent [08-CRUD-testing.md](08-CRUD-testing.md) doc to verify that everything works.


*As a developer, I want to review my code base so that I have a deep understanding of its overall functionality.*

- Study each of the new routes in your server.js file by examining the SQL statements and any associated data being handed through the request.
- For each of the `COMMENT` items in server.js, provide a brief description of what that function immediately below is doing. Be sure to indicate, where applicable, details such as:
  - What number(s) of the full-stack-diagram.png image is this part of the code interacting with?
  - Which method of article.js is interacting with this particular piece of server.js?
  - What part of ***CRUD*** is being enacted/managed by this particular piece of code?
  - As applicable, an additional sentence or two of explanation about what the code is doing, what NPM packages are involved, etc. The goal is to demonstrate that you understand what is going on in the code without glossing over details, but also without writing a novel about it.

## Documentation
_Your README.md must include:_

```md
# Project Name
