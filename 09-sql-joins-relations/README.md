=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*The purpose of this class is to introduce the concepts of database normalization through the use of SQL joins.*

## Daily Plan

**Code Review!!**

`10 minute break`

**More Code Review?**

**Slides on SQL joins**

Also see this [reference document on joins](joins.md)

- Normalization & Joins

	- Database Relationships
	- 1:1 Rel
	- 1:Many / Many:1 Rel
	- Many:Many Rel (Includes Junction Tables)
	- Self-referencing Rel

- Database Normalization

	- Remove duplicate data
	- Minimize database redesign
	- Minimize modification anomalies

- Joins

- Understanding Primary and Foreign Keys

	- Discuss how these keys are related and can be used for database normalization

- Inner Join

	- Discuss syntax
	- Discuss concepts

- High Level Overview of Other Join types

**SQL Joins Demo**

**Lab Prep**

Be sure to carefully follow the setup instructions in the lab README to get the  lab up and running. You need to do a **DROP TABLE** on the ***articles*** table from the prior lab to prevent problems. Now we have two tables, one of which, 'articles', is the same name as the table we used previously but has a different structure, so it needs to be obliterated and shown no mercy and killed with fire from space.

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

- Understand how objects in a database can be interrelated with foreign keys
- Have familiarity with queries using SQL that select data from across multiple tables
- Have familiarity with different relationships in database tables
